This software package contains the Auto Tuning Optimization System (ATOS) tools.

After installation (see INSTALL file) the following tools are available:
* Top level tools:
 * atos-explore: automatic optimization system for a build and run system that generate a build configuration to be used by atos-play (see atos-explore -h)
 * atos-play: build system optimizer for a build system (see atos-play -h)

* Companion tools:
 * atos-audit: auditing tool for a build system that generates a build template to be used by atos-opt (see atos-audit -h)
 * atos-raudit: auditing tool for a run system that generates a run template to be used by atos-run (see atos-raudit -h)
 * atos-deps: specify executables targets and complete the auditing process (see atos-deps -h)
 * atos-opt: replay build audited by atos-audit with custome options injection (see atos-opt -h)
 * atos-run: rerun benchmark audited by atos-raudit (see atos-opt -h) 
 * atos-profile: specific rebuild!rerun for genrating application profiles (see atos-profile -h)

* Typical usage:
A simple usage of the atos-explore tool is to provide a script for building
the application (compile.sh for instance) and a script for running the
benchmarks (exec.sh for instance), then run the atos-explore tool with the
executable(s) to instrument as argument.
For instance:
$ atos-explore -b ./compile.sh -r ./exec.sh bzip2
....
Best Size configuration: ...
Best performance configuration: ...

Then in order to replay the build for best size or best perf, use the
atos-play tool:
$ atos-play
... compile your application for best performance
$ atos-play -f size
... compile your application for best code size
