TODO:
* Run exploration also for one executable at a time, instead of all at once when multiple executables are specified.
* Find a solution for makefiles that remove intermediate targets .c files. For instance mibench/office/ghostscript remove some .c files and thus atos-opt does not work.
* Use interposition for instrumenting executable instead of /usr/bin/time of top level run script.
* Validate atos-explore on EEMBC, Spec and Webkit.
* Handle executables that are links. For instance mibench/telecom/gsm as a ln toast untoast command, hence untoast cannot be audited.
* Check build dependencies in mibench/telecom/gsm, it seems that toast build is missing .o recompilation.v

Done:
* Remove results output in atos-profile, for this add a -s option to atos-run for silent operation. => done
* If no exe is passed to atos-explore use -a option for atos-deps. => done
* Automatize detection of target executables: would avoid atos-deps <executables> command. Possibly use interposition in raudit and auto detect execution of programs under the current dir. => cancelled: -a or -l option is passed to atos-deps, if atos-explore does not give executable, -a option is used.
