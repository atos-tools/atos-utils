This directory contains some helper scripts for gerrit code review.

* Pushing a new change for review: push-change

Once you have in your HEAD some commits ready for review, execute the command:
$ contrib/gerrit/push-change
Pushing new changes on ref HEAD to remote ssh://gnx5855.gnb.st.com:29418/atos.
...
remote: New Changes:
remote:   http://gnx5855.gnb.st.com:9000/16
...

An optional ref to be pushed can be given as additional argument (defaults to HEAD).

* Updating the patchset for an existing change: update-change

If you have to modify a patchset, amend your commit and push a new patchset for the change:
$ contrib/gerrit/update-change 16
Updating patchset 16 with ref HEAD to remote ssh://gnx5855.gnb.st.com:29418/atos.
...
remote: Processing changes: updated: 1, refs: 1, done
...

An optional ref to be pushed can be given as additional argument (defaults to HEAD).

* Gerrit configuration

The gerrit configuration is located in file contrib/gerrit/config.sh
If you have to locally change the configuration, override any parameter there
into a local file contrib/gerrit/local.sh.

Note also that you may define yourself your gerrit remote with for instance
git remote add gerrit ssh://gnx5855.gnb.st.com:29418/atos
in this case the gerrit remote will take precedence over the server & project
parameters defined in config.sh

* Default behavior

The default behavior is to simply push changes for the master branch, i.e.
equivalent to:
$ git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/master
or
$ git push $server/$project HEAD:refs/for/master

In addition it sets the reviewers list as defined in the config.sh parameters.

You can still use the standard git/gerrit commands instead of these helper scripts,
they are provided for ease of use, they do not perform change in the standard
gerrit flow.
