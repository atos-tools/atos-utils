This directory contains helper scripts for validations with a build scheduler.

* Local validation

One can launch the validation script from its user environment with:
$ env DEBUG=1 WORKSPACE=<existing_tmpdir> GITROOT=<source_tree> validate.sh

WORKSPACE must be a temporary directory for the build.
GITROOT must point to the source root tree.

* Jenkins validation

For instance in a Jenkins project where the git trigger is configured to track
the atos-utils repository, one can directly call from the Jenkins shell script:
$GITROOT/contrib/jenkins/validate.sh

Jenkins will have set for you the WORKSPACE and GITROOT envvars.
