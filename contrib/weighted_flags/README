This directory contains scripts to analyze the behavior of individual
GCC flags on some benchmarks and then output a ranking of best and
worst flags.

The entry point is the shell script "static_flag_ranking.sh". It must
be called with a list of directories which each contains a benchmark
to be used to evaluate the flags. Each benchmark directory must
contain a file "atos-init.sh" that will call "atos init -C $1 ...."
(see file oneflag.py to look at the use of this script)

This script will evaluate the effect of individual flags at different
optimization levels and variants, using the list of benchmarks
provided on the command line

It will then output a set of flags ranking that can be added in the
*.cfg files for ATOS

example

cd /home/compwork/ferriere/ATOS/atos-ranking
../ranking.explorations/static_flag_ranking.sh atos-build/atos-utils/examples/bzip2 atos-build/atos-utils/examples/sha1 atos-build/atos-utils/examples/astar
