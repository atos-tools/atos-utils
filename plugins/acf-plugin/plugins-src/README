The aim of these gcc plugins is to perform dedicated checks for STLinux client applications, like SDK2.
Today the delivered plugins are :
 1) The BarrierChecker plugin 
    The BarrierChecker plugin currently can perform two kinds of checks :
     - memory barrier static checker (compilation warning when detecting that a MB is missing) 
     - memory barrier dynamic checker (instrument the code to perform some checks at runtime)
 2) The acf-plugin plugin
    The acf-plugin allows to apply GCC compiler flags and params at function level so as to
    fine tune the performance of an application.
