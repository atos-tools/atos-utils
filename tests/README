Run all regression tests with:
make -j8 tests

Each regression test can be run in isolation:
./test001.sh

Each test creates its own working directory in a tmp dir, use
env KEEPTEST=1 ./test001.sh
in order to keep the working directory, in this case
the directory name is outputed to stdout.

For debugging, use 
env DEBUG=1 KEEPTEST=1 ./test001.sh
for verbose output (it does a set -x).
